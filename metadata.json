  "description": "Nillion is a permissionless network designed to revolutionize secure, decentralized data storage and computation for AI and blockchain ecosystems. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC), Nillion enables decentralized AI and blockchain applications to process and store sensitive data without ever exposing it in plaintext. This creates a groundbreaking 'white space' for privacy-preserving solutions, empowering developers to build innovative applications that handle private data securely and efficiently. Nillion aims to bridge the gap between scalability, privacy, and decentralization, making it a key infrastructure layer for the future of Web3 and AI-driven technologies.",
